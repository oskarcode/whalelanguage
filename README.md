# 🐋 Whale Language Translator

A fun and interactive web application that transforms regular text into "whale speak" language by modifying vowel patterns.

## Features

- **Interactive Text Transformation**: Convert any text into whale language with a simple button click
- **Smart Vowel Processing**: Automatically transforms vowels according to whale speak rules
- **Real-time Display**: See results instantly on the webpage
- **Simple Interface**: Clean, user-friendly design

## How It Works

The whale language translator follows these transformation rules:
- **'e'** becomes **'ee'** (sounds like whale calls)
- **'u'** becomes **'uu'** (deeper whale sounds)
- All other vowels and consonants remain unchanged
- Maintains original text structure and spacing

## Demo

Try the example: "i love kaitlin" becomes "ii lovee kaitliinn"

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Click the "try it" button to see the transformation
3. The result will be displayed in uppercase format
4. Check the browser console for additional output

## Technical Details

- **Frontend**: HTML5, JavaScript, DOM Manipulation
- **Algorithm**: String processing with vowel pattern matching
- **Browser Support**: All modern browsers
- **No Dependencies**: Pure vanilla JavaScript

## Code Structure

```javascript
const speakWhale = (input, vowels) => {
    // Main transformation logic
    // Iterates through each character
    // Applies whale speak rules to vowels
}
```

## Project Purpose

This project demonstrates:
- Basic JavaScript programming concepts
- String manipulation and character processing
- DOM interaction and event handling
- User interface development
- Algorithm implementation for text transformation

## Live Demo

You can view the live demo by opening the `index.html` file in any web browser or visiting the GitHub Pages deployment.
